      <p>
        Hi, I&apos;m Yugabdh Pashte, or as a lot of people call me, Yuga. I live
        in Mumbai, India. I pursued a bachelor of engineering degree with a
        specialisation in information technology from Pillai College of
        Engineering, Panvel. Why engineering? Well, I always wanted to build
        something of my own. I also enjoyed dismantling things. This first got
        me into web development. I started with writing plain HTML pages and am
        currently continuing my journey by developing some complex applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked on technologies like{" "}
